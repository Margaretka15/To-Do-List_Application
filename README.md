# To-Do-List_Application

Personal project for online course on Pirple.com "Keeping Up With the Javascripts: ES6".


# Description 
This description was copied & pasted from the course resources. 

* Project #1 
Create a simple "to-do list" application, using client-side HTML, CSS, and Javascript only. This application should store its data using localStorage only, and should not connect to any external APIs, backends, databases etc. This should function as a "Single Page Application", so the page should never actually refresh or reload, and no links should direct to any other page.

# Details
There were more requirements in this project but I don't want this readme to be too long. In short, user should be able to:
- sign up, log in
- create new lists (categories) and tasks
- change name of the lists
- remove tasks from their lists and remove lists
- update their personal data
